🚀 Project Overview

This project about courses based on user inputs such as course category (Programming, AI, ML), difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), and whether the course is paid or free, using an ML algorithm (K-Means). We are committed to building a user interface that will evolve iteratively, applying Agile methodology for continuous improvement and feedback.

 🌟 Key Milestones


1. Data Collection 📊  
   We gathered data from educational platforms and stored them in Excel to train our model, ensuring relevant and accurate course recommendations. We collected data from Edraak, Udemy, Coursera, Hasoub, Code academy, Solo learn, Edx and LinkedIn platforms.

2. Model Training & Evaluation 🤖  
   We will train our model using a machine learning algorithm (K-Means) to understand user preferences and recommend the most appropriate courses. Model will be continually improved to improve accuracy and efficiency.

3. User Interface Development 🖥  
   We will design and implement an interface using (Tkinter library) that allows users to easily interact.

4. Code Implementation & Integration 💻  
   We'll integrate all components, ensuring smooth operation from data processing to model deployment.

5. Continuous Testing & Feedback 🔄

   We will apply Agile methodology for continuous testing and feedback, allowing us to make ongoing improvements and adjustments to ensure our solution remains user-centric.

📅 Timeline & Deliverables
