🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the [Team-8] repository! This project is designed to recommend the best courses tailored to your needs using ML algorithm, with a strong focus on delivering value through Agile methodologies. We are committed to building a user interface. The project will evolve iteratively.

 🌟 Key Milestones

1. Data Collection 📊  
   Our journey begins with gathering comprehensive datasets from various educational platforms. This crucial step ensures our model is trained on the most relevant and up-to-date information, enabling accurate course recommendations.We collected data in Excel file to train model

2. User Interface Development 🖥  
   The user experience is at the heart of our project. We'll design and implement a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to easily interact.

3. Model Training & Optimization 🤖  
   Harnessing the power of machine learning, we will train our models to understand user preferences and suggest courses that best match their needs. We'll continually refine and optimize the models for greater accuracy and efficiency.

4. Code Implementation & Integration 💻  
   We will develop and integrate all necessary components, from data processing pipelines to model deployment. This phase ensures that all parts of the project work seamlessly together.

5. Continuous Testing & Feedback 🔄  
   Adopting Agile practices, we will regularly test and gather feedback on each iteration, making improvements where necessary to ensure that our solution remains user-centric and high-performing.
