🚀 Project Overview

This project is designed to recommend courses based on your inputs using ML algorithm. We are committed to building a user interface. The project will evolve iteratively.

 🌟 Key Milestones

1. Data Collection 📊  
   We gathered datasets from educational platforms and stored them in Excel to train our model, ensuring relevant and accurate course recommendations.

2. User Interface Development 🖥  
   We'll design and implement interface that allows users to easily interact.

3. Model Training & Optimization 🤖  
   Harnessing the power of machine learning, we will train our models to understand user preferences and suggest courses that best match their needs. We'll continually refine and optimize the models for greater accuracy and efficiency.

4. Code Implementation & Integration 💻  
   We'll integrate all components, ensuring smooth operation from data processing to model deployment.

5. Continuous Testing & Feedback 🔄
   We will apply Agile methodology for continuous testing and feedback, allowing us to make ongoing improvements and adjustments to ensure our solution remains user-centric.
