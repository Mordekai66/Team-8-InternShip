In this sprint, our primary focus was on designing the user interface and integrating the model with the Gemini API.

Key activities during this phase included:

  - ðŸ”§ User interface design: We created a user interface using (Tkinter library).
    
  - ðŸ”— Model Integration with Gemini API: After finalizing the UI, we integrated the model with the Gemini API, ensuring smooth data integration for accurate and reliable recommendations.

Through these activities, we are preparing to move on to the next steps in the project, which will involve testing the user interface and refining the integration with the API.

Note: We are continuing to collect data and will update these files regularly.
